    <p>
        This tool can parse the <span class="preformatted">google-services.json</span> file and
        generate the appropriate string resources the same way the Google Services Gradle Plugin
        does. It can also generate Java code to initialize Firebase using
        <span class="preformatted">FirebaseOptions</span> class.
    </p>
    <p>
        This can be useful in all kinds of situations requiring manual Firebase configuration,
        for example if you want to connect Analytics to one Firebase project and FCM to another or
        if you're developing a library that needs configuration for one service only and you don't
        want to pollute the namespace with unneeded resources.
